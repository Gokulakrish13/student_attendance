# Student_attendance_system
**INTRODUCTION:** 

This project is a system that takes down student’s attendance. This is an interesting concept set forth to automate the traditional attendance system by using advanced online technique. The traditional system requires a register maintained for manually marking attendance for the students which is time consuming. Hence this proposed project eliminates the need of maintaining an offline attendance sheet. The proposed system uses a online attendance method for students which reduces time and a easier process to maintain. 

**SCOPE:**

“Attendance Management System” is software developed for maintaining the attendance of the student on the daily basis in the collage. Here the staffs, who are handling the subjects, will be responsible to mark the attendance of the students. Each staff will be given with a separate username and password based on the subject they handle. An accurate report based on the student attendance is generated here. This system will also help in evaluating attendance eligibility criteria of a student. Report of the student’s attendance on weekly and monthly basis is generated.
